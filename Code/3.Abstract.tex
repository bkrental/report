\prefacesection{Abstract}
To solve the difficulty in finding the accommodations, we developed a system that allows the landlord to post their rental information and users to search for their desired rental. Besides that, we also have a crawler service to collect rental data from different sources such as Facebook and some popular real estate websites to enrich our rental data. Then we build a chatbot to help students search for the rental information.

\noindent Our main focus is on web development technology, data crawling techniques and how to apply the machine learning model in the Natural Language Processing field, especially in the Intent Classification and Name Entity Recognition task.
